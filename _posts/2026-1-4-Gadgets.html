<!--excerpt-start-->
<p>As I’ve grown older, I’ve become increasingly dissatisfied with technology. I’m referring primarily to computers and their software, because that is what I work with most often, but my frustration applies to many other technologies. The ways I have used technology have changed significantly from childhood, to adolescence, and now to adulthood, and so I cannot be sure that my attitude to technology has changed due to lifestyle changes or changes in the technological landscape itself. As I’ve tried to understand what bothers me about modern technology, I’ve developed a framework for categorizing technologies that I think could be helpful to discussions about technology.</p>
<!--excerpt-end-->
<p>The two categories I like to divide technologies into are “tools” and “gadgets”. A tool is something that you use to do something. The skill with which you employ the tool has a direct result on the outcome of the task. A gadget however, just works, regardless of your skill level.</p>
<p>For example, my last birthday I receive a knife sharpener that I would classify as a gadget. The Precision Adjust™ Knife Sharpener just works. You fasten your knife into the clamp, select the angle you wish the blade’s edge to be sharpened to, and grind the edge with the three progressively finer faces of the Tri-Abrasive™ Rod which moves on a pivoting arm to ensure you get a consistent edge. Despite my lack of skill in knife sharpening, I was able to make my cheap, Walmart knives a bit sharper and I’m sure I could get even better results if I spend a bit more time on them.</p>
<p>Contrast this with a set of whetstones (note the lack of “™”). If I had a set of whetstones instead, I would have had to spend significantly more time just learning how to properly use them. A whetstone is a tool. If you have no skill, it will be useless to you until you gain skill. Once you have skill, using it becomes more natural.</p>
<p>My knife sharpener is a wonderful gadget, that does what it needs to do, but it will never be seamless to use, because it assumes that the user is incompetent. When sharpening a knife, it is important to alternate strokes (or sets of strokes) on each edge. With a whetstone, alternating sides is as simple as switching the way you hold the knife. This is no more difficult than any other motion you make while using a whetstone. With The Precision Adjust™ Knife Sharpener, you have to rotate the clamp that holds the blade. This behavior can be clunky, especially with a large knife. If the blade is long enough, the rotation will either cause it to run into the sharpening arm, or the countertop you rest the gadget on. No amount of skill with it will ever make this action less clunky.</p>
<p>Another gadget I use is my budgeting app, app.monarch.com. It is wonderful, but it has its limitations. It can only do the things it is designed to do. For example, it can show you your spending in each category of expense as a percentage of your total spending (e.g. I can quickly see that in December 3.2% of my spending was on gas). You cannot see the percentages of your spending relative to your income. I was very confused one month to see the amount I had tithed was significantly above 10% before I realized that it was calculated as a percentage of my spending, not my income. If you want this statistic, you have to calculate it yourself.</p>
<p>However, if I had been using a spreadsheet instead, I could have easily create a new table that would show my spending in each category as a percentage of my income. Of course, using a spreadsheet instead of an app has its own downsides. I would have to create this feature myself, in addition to every other feature that monarch provides. As it is, I have to live with the limitations of monarch, wait for this feature to be added, or find a new budgeting app. This leads to another observation about the difference between tools and gadgets. If you identify a shortcoming in a gadget, the problem can only be solved by getting a different gadget. If you identify a shortcoming with a tool, the problem is with you.</p>
<p>I have mentioned two gadgets so far that I greatly appreciate. Without an easy to use knife sharpener and budgeting app, I would likely spend too much money on fancy, pre-sharpened kitchen knives. Though I appreciate these gadgets, I do not love them. In fact, I have yet to find any gadget that I love. Not so with tools. I love manual transmission (i.e. “stick-shift”) cars, which I consider to be tools. I can love a tool, and I can hate a gadget, but I have not yet found a gadget I love or a tool that I hate.</p>
<p>I mentioned that my frustration is most often with digital technology, and so I will give an example. I consider the Linux family of operating systems to be more like a tool than the Windows operating system, which I consider to be a gadget. I will use Linux whenever I can help it. If you install Discord, or Spotify, or any other number of programs on Windows, they will start up automatically as soon as you boot up the computer. I’m sure that this can be disabled, but I’m frustrated that I have to. Because these programs start up every time I boot my PC with Windows, it is very slow for several minutes. When I boot my PC up with Ubuntu Linux, it is snappy and responsive because it only boots up the programs necessary to the operating system. When I need another program, I boot it up, and it boots quickly. I find this behavior of gadgets frustrating; they try to anticipate what you want. When they are right you don’t notice, and when they are wrong, you’re annoyed. This is a net negative experience.</p>
<p>This idea leads into what may be the only practical use of this paradigm, the discussion of the inherent morality of technology. Whether a piece of technology can or cannot have an inherent moral value is a question that has been much pondered by people with far more free time than me, so I will not wade too deeply into it. Gadgets assume a certain use-case, this is why they try to anticipate your objective. The use-case they are built for may very well be an action that has a significant moral value. A reasonable person may disagree, but I think this means that the gadget itself has a moral value. A tool on the other hand, will likely have a more general use-case, and therefore a more ambiguous moral value, or perhaps none at all.</p>
<p>The serious shortcoming of this paradigm is that this distinction seems to be subject to the technology of the present. No doubt, spreadsheet programs like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets seemed like gadgets compared to the pencil and paper methods that predated them, and automobiles with any kind of transmission seemed like gadgets compared to horse and buggies.</p>
<p>I do not think this subjectivity renders this distinction meaningless. The use of technology is always culturally dependent. One of the things I love about tools is that they require patience and discipline. Patience and discipline are culturally dependent, that is to say that riding a horse and buggy in 21st century America requires patience and discipline because they are slow (which is a relative distinction), but before the advent of trains, they were the fastest way to travel in comfort over land, and required neither patience, nor discipline, only money.</p>
<p>I hope that you find this paradigm as useful as I do. Once I realized that there is a way to classify the kinds of technology that frustrate me separately from the kinds of technology that I like, I was able to much more clearly express my preferences when debating with my friends. I hope this new terminology will be useful to you as well.</p>
