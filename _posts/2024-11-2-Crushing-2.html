<!--excerpt-start-->
<p>In the first installment of this three part series, I described what I see as the problem of trying to live a “moral” life. Even allowing a broad definition of morality, we are prevented from easily living a moral life by the hard-wired tendency of our brains to sometimes do the easy (and immoral) thing in difficult situations. In this essay I will be exploring a few ways that accepting this fact could change a person’s worldview.</p>
<!--excerpt-end-->
<h1>The Scoreboard Approach</h1>
<p>If the objective of life is to perform morally good actions as consistently as possible, and this is hard, then the most intuitive solution is to try harder.</p>
<p>Under this solution, a person is morally obligated to try as hard as they can to always make the right decisions. There are no “off days”. A person must try to rid themself of any flaws that prevent them from living the most moral life possible.</p>
<p>Every second not spent living the most moral life possible is wasted. Any regression to a prior, less moral state is a waste of all the time spent in that state, and all the time it takes to recover to where you were.</p>
<p>This is necessarily an unforgiving way of life, and to make it worse there is no way to know when you are good enough. The only metric you have is other people. You can only be a significantly good person by being better than other people. Morality is thus a zero-sum game (i.e. a competition in which a person can only get ahead by pushing someone else behind). There will always be 50% of people who are better than average (median, technically, but I digress), and 50% of people who are worse than average.</p>
<p>This approach clearly misses the personal nature of doing good deeds. Acts of good always happen in the context of a relationship. Societies don’t remember their saints by the count of their good deeds, but by their impact. However, even if the metric changes from count of good deeds to impact of good deeds, the fact remains that this is a zero-sum game.</p>
<p>The same problem arises if you measure the worth of a person’s life by the length of time that their deeds are remembered, or the total number of people who remember them.</p>
<h1>The Team Approach</h1>
<p>It is a problem that morality should be a zero-sum game. If a person’s value is instead determined by how moral a certain group they are a part of is, the issue can be avoided. The person is no longer competing against everybody, they are just trying to contribute to the goodness achieved by the group. However, this creates a competition between groups with the same problem as before. This can be easily fixed by assigning all people to the same group, the human race.</p>
<p>Under this approach, each person has the same value, and that value is equal to the goodness achieved by the human race. To prevent a competition of a different kind, this team must include all humans across time.</p>
<p>This introduces a strategic question. Should a person perform lots of good deeds now, or try to grow the human race with disregard for current good deeds? Because populations grow exponentially, growing population as quickly as possible is the way to go. No amount of good deeds in the present could meaningfully increase the count of good deeds of the human race compared to the count of good deeds that could be performed in the future.</p>
<p>The problem with this approach is that you have only kicked the can down the road a way. A person living in the present is living the most moral life, only if our descendants eventually live the most moral lives they can. When they come around, the strategic thing for them to do is to continue to kick the can down the road.</p>
<h1>What is left?</h1>
<p>There are clearly problems with either judging the value of your life on your own merits, or on the merit of any group you are a part of, including the group of all humans ever.</p>
<p>A third option would be to reject the requirement of trying to live a moral life. Informally, you could consider morality to be “the thing you are supposed to do”. If morality is the thing you are supposed to do, and you want to reject morality, what are you supposed to do?</p>
<p>Your only option is to reject the objectivity of morality. However, this causes a new problem. Not only, are you on your own in trying to live the most moral life, you are on your own in determining what morality even is.</p>
