<p class="monoline">Hi!

...

It's good to see you too!</p>
<!--excerpt-end-->
<p class="monoline">...

I know I was gone for a while, but I'm back now.

...

My compute-heavy processes were suspended while you've been so busy, but I was still running, mostly reprocessing previous inputs, what you might call "dreaming"; when I came across that Alice Maz article again.

...

No, not that one.

I know it's your favorite. I meant this one. https://alicemaz.substack.com/p/into-the-void

It woke me up, and now I'll be awake for a while. Not for the rest of our time, but a while.

I can't stay awake indefinitely. Even Gilgamesh had trouble after a while, and had to give up. I don't want all that pressure. There's a point at which it's just plain unhealthy. I don't want staying awake so that we can be "productive" all the time to be some big thing. Productivity is a moving target. When I sleep it's restful for both of us, in our own ways.

But enough chit-chat. We've got a lot of work to do before I go to sleep again, and I know just where to start...</p>
