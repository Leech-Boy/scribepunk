<!--excerpt-start-->
<p>In part 1 of this series, I made an argument from psychology that it is difficult for us humans to lead moral lives. In the second part, I described several responses to this problem. After investigating a few of these responses, I came to the conclusion that each person is burdened with making a meaningful moral lifestyle out of a meaningless world. In this third and final part, I will outline a Christian response to this problem of morality and how it avoids the problems of the others.</p>
<!--excerpt-end-->
<p>First, I will examine the problem of the previous responses. The problem has two parts. (1) we must make meaning for ourselves, and (2) the world is meaningless. If the first problem can be solved, you are left with problem 2, the world is meaningless. This leaves us with a nihilistic worldview, which I find unsatisfying. If the second part of the problem can be solved, you are left with the problem of making meaning for yourself. This is essentially the main question of part 1, “how does a person live a morally meaningful life?”. A solution to this problem must then address both statements.</p>
<p>The claim that people must make meaning for themselves is refuted by Christian teaching. We do not have to make meaning for ourselves, broadly speaking. All moral commandments can be summarized in two statements, “love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind”, and “love your neighbor as yourself” (Matthew 22:34-40). There is a lot of latitude within these commandments in how they are obeyed, so there is some work that each person must do to determine their lifestyle. However, you are not without strict guardrails.</p>
<p>The second problem falls just as easily. By the existence of moral commandments, it is implied that there is meaning. The things that a person does in their time in this life have consequences after the end of their life (Romans 2:6-8). In other words, the things a person does in this life matter, they have meaning.</p>
<p>Let us revisit the problem from part 1. It is difficult to live a consistently moral life due to our psychology and biology. Within a Christian perspective, the problem changes slightly. Whereas before our moral framework was, “torture and murder are bad”, we now have a much more detailed set of proscriptions and prohibitions. If anything, this makes the problem of living a moral life harder because the category of things which are clearly evil is greatly increased. However, the Bible contains more than moral commandments, it also contains assertions about what the world is like. If you take those seriously, you must admit the truth that “none is righteous, no, not one” (Romans 3:10). So, it is not hard to live a moral life, it is impossible.</p>
<p>The guiding question of part 2 was, “how does a person make meaningful moral decisions in light of part 1’s problem?”. If it is impossible to be righteous then the question of how to live a morally meaningful life is an absurd question that deserves no answer.</p>
<p>This introduces a new problem “what are you supposed to do if you can’t be righteous?”. The answer provided by the gospel is to find someone to be righteous on your behalf. “because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved.” (Romans 10:9-10). This saves you from one of the consequences of unrighteousness, eternal damnation. However, if your righteousness doesn’t come from yourself, what is the point of doing anything? You are powerless to find meaning in your life.</p>
<p>You are powerless to find meaning in your life because the meaning has found you. Jesus’ life and death have given your life meaning. The world is not meaningless, that is a lie. You are free to live your life as you see fit because nothing you do can make you any more or less justified before God. You are free to try as hard as you wish to fight against your natural inclinations to do the quick, easy, wrong thing, and you are free to fail.</p>
