<p>This post is the first of a new series that I hope to add to periodically. As someone who works with computers professionally, I have learned a few things that make them easier to work with, without losing your sanity to the soulless algorithms or losing all your data to for-profit corporations. With this series, I will be sharing some of the tools I use to improve my digital experience in easy-to-follow tutorials. It is my intention, that anyone who regularly uses computers, either desktop, laptop, or smartphones will be able to benefit from these posts, regardless of how tech-savvy they consider themselves to be.</p>

<p>At some point, many years ago, I thought that it would be cool if you could connect to a social media website with a customized algorithm. Instead of consuming content chosen for you by an algorithm created by the makers of the platform, you would be shown content chosen by your own algorithm, or by an algorithm created by some altruistic third party. For example, you could go to some sort of “algorithm marketplace” and download an algorithm that prioritizes content made by small creators in your geographic area, or an algorithm that shows you more of the content that your friends like, or more of the content that your favorite creators like.</p>
<p>I forget where I got this idea. It could very well have been taken straight from that Netflix documentary about social media that was popular some number of years ago (I don’t remember what it was called, but if you know, you know, and if you don’t it’s inconsequential). I don’t think this technology will ever exist for mainstream social media, because it takes control away from the platform, but since that time I’ve discovered the next best thing.</p>
<p>It’s called RSS and it’s existed since 1999. RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication. It’s a tool that allows you to create a personalized feed of posts collected (or <strong>syndicated</strong>) from a variety of platforms. And it’s <strong>really simple</strong> to use. I love it because I can have all the internet content that I know is worth consuming in one place. No more going to YouTube to check out what my favorite creators have posted only to get sucked down a rabbit hole by the YouTube home page, no more endlessly scrolling through Substack notes, no more missing out on the latest content on some random website that is only updated twice a year. I can go to one webpage and see everything worth seeing, all the YouTube videos, Substack posts, and other internet content from all my favorite creators and I can read or watch it right there, without even going to the site it came from.</p>
<p>Here’s what that looks like:</p>
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/image/inoreader.png">
<p>It looks like a typical social media page with content in the middle, my favorite sources on the left, and settings on the far left. The difference is I will never see anything I’m not subscribed to, I will never see something I’ve already read or watched, and I can’t scroll forever. Once I scroll to the bottom of the page (which has only 30 posts in this picture) I’m done scrolling.</p>
<p>The best part is you can set this up in five minutes.</p>
<h1>How it works</h1>
<p>If you are already sold on this, you may proceed to the next section. If you are interested or confused, it may be helpful to read this first.</p>
<p>RSS is like the radio. Websites have RSS feeds, those are the sources I’m subscribed to. They are analogous to a radio station. In order to use RSS you need an RSS feed reader. This is analogous to a radio like the one in your car. I use inoreader which is a free online RSS feed reader.</p>
<p>Whenever a content is added to a website with an RSS feed, for example a new comic is posted to xkcd.com, the website makes a record of the last time the page was updated. This functions as an announcement to the whole internet of new content. Your RSS feed reader will listen for these announcements by checking every website you’ve subscribed to at regular intervals to see if it has been updated since it was last checked. If it has been updated, your reader will show you the new content the next time you check on it.</p>
<h1>Getting set up</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Identify the things you want to see. Not everything can go into an RSS feed reader. As I’ve mentioned YouTube channels and Substack pages have RSS feeds, as do most blogs and podcasts, but that will require more research</li>
  <li>Go to inoreader.com and make an account.</li>
  <li>Click the plus sign that says “Add Feed” on the sidebar and enter the url to one of the sources that you care about (YouTube channel, Substack page, etc.)</li>
  <li>Repeat for every other source.</li>
  <li>And you’re done! You have your very own algorithm, serving you only the content that you want to see.</li>
</ol>
<p>For Substack and YouTube this process works perfectly. For other websites it may not be as simple as adding the url to the website’s home page, you may need to find the link for the RSS feed itself.</p>
<p>For example, to get an RSS feed to my blog (which has exclusive content not posted on Substack), giving inoreader the url to the front page <a href="https://leech-boy.github.io/scribepunk/index.html">https://leech-boy.github.io/scribepunk/index.html</a>, will not work. You need to provide the link to the RSS feed itself, which is <a href="https://leech-boy.github.io/scribepunk/feed.xml">https://leech-boy.github.io/scribepunk/feed.xml</a>. If you follow that link, you will get to a page that shows a whole bunch of gibberish. This is supposed to happen. Just copy the url and put that in inoreader, or your RSS feed reader of choice, and you’re good to go!</p>
<h1>Final Thoughts</h1>
<p>Inoreader is not the only, or best RSS feed reader, however it is free and easy to use. In the spirit of making this tutorial easy to follow I have not provided any opportunities to make decisions. One downside of inoreader is that it prioritizes more popular feeds, that is it checks for updates more regularly on feeds that have a lot of subscribers so you may get very slow updates from feeds that not many people subscribe to.</p>
<p>I’ve never written a tech tutorial for a non-technical audience before. If you found this confusing, leave a comment, or shoot me a direct message on Substack. Or, if you liked this and start using RSS, let me know! I’d love to hear about it.</p>
