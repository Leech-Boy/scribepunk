title: "Death is Bad"
---

<p>I was mindlessly scrolling through my Substack homepage, when I read a note that referenced this story.</p>

<a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/zoraya-ter-beek-dead-assisted-suicide">She Was 29. And Doctors Helped Her Die.</a>
<p>I was stopped dead in my (digital) tracks.</p>

<p>I didn’t even read the article, and I was still too upset to sit still. I went for a walk. After walking a bit, I sat down and tracked down the article that the note referenced and started reading it. After reading most of the article I had to start walking again. I was too angry.</p>

<p class="quote">“My whole friends and my support system, we really did it together.”</p>

<p>In what kind of world does a person’s “support system” help them towards suicide. This is not support, this is abandonment.</p>

<p>Eventually, I finished reading the article. All the while my mind was reeling at the darkness of the world.</p>

<p>The words of a poem floated through my head, so I decided to write it down. At the end of the poem, I also reference the life and death of Terry Davis, another outcast whose tragically took his own life.</p>

<p class="line">A sick woman is betrayed by those who swore to heal her.</p>
<p class="line">They give up on her and offer death.</p>
<p class="line">She no longer wishes to live, and they pronounce her mind sound.</p>
<p class="line">A contradiction.</p>
<p class="line">Not that she wishes to die, for to die is gain,</p>
<p class="line">but that she wishes to give up on life, the greatest gift.</p>
