<!--excerpt-start-->
<p>Where do you go when the going is over?
Whom do you fight when the battle is done?</p>
<!--excerpt-end-->
<p>Man stands alone on the peak of the mountain,
tall, dark, commanding, but he is alone.
Wounds have been sutured and fevers have broken.
Bags have been readied, and tears have been stitched.
Far from his homeland, his friends and his family,
bearing the weight of this terrible curse.
If love is the curse, then the curing is hopeless
for curse it is, present, or absent, or wrong,
but hate was the curse that had spoiled his spirit,
hatred of man and a hatred of God.
Alone in the vastness of space he finds respite.
The demon awaits him if he should return.
He climbed from this shadow of death from the valley;
The shadow departed when he touched the sky.
The shadow awaits should he come down the mountain.
Dilemma confronts him, his friends are below.
He climbed without them, though not without sendoff.
They watched from the ground as he fled from his foe.
Sun lit his journey, his friends came to see him,
tenderly bandaging all of his wounds.
Fog hid his figure. His friends did not seek him.
Trembling hands, can’t but worsen his wounds.
Better malpractice by hands of a loved one,
than the best surgery completed alone.
Spurred by the prophecy of his deliverance,
midst that rock fortress that’s older than hate.
Not by the torture of spirits he’s hurt now,
but only the dull ache of something not right.
Not that he misses those hands that had healed him,
but that he wishes, those friends he could help.
How do you love when you’re far from the lovely?
How do you tell them you love them from here?</p>
