title: "The Crushing Weight of Being Human: Part 1"
---

<p>All people live under a curse. We are fighting a war every day, just in trying to do the right thing. In the words of the apostle Paul:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing.</p>
<p>Romans 7:19 (ESV)</p>
</div>

<p>As I will explain, the natural disposition of our brains is to do the easy thing, even when that thing is clearly wrong.</p>

<!--excerpt-start-->
<p>In this short series, I will be exploring the idea of living a “good life”. A life characterized by moral living.</p>

<p>For the purpose of this essay, it will suffice to use a very loose definition of right and wrong. When I make statements about morality, I am appealing to widely held cultural beliefs, such as the belief that the murder or torture of innocent people is wrong.</p>

<h1>The Bystander Effect</h1>
<p>The Bystander Effect is the phenomenon that the more people there are at the scene of a crisis who can help, the less likely it is that any help will be given. This phenomenon first gained the interest of psychologists after press coverage of the murder of Kitty Genovese. Kitty was murdered close to her New York apartment in 1964. She yelled for help, but no one from the densely populated apartment buildings around her came to help, despite the fact that many people heard her screams.</p>

<p>Although a modern reevaluation of the facts has shown that the degree and number of people who ignored Kitty’s cry for help was initially exaggerated, it is still shocking that someone should be so vulnerable in such a populated area.</p>

<p>Since the murder of Kitty Genovese, there has been much research into The Bystander Effect, including successful attempts at duplicating it in less extreme contexts and attempts to understand why it occurs.</p>

<p>The simplest explanation of this phenomenon is that people don’t want to go through the trouble of offering help when they think that someone else will, or already has provided help. In a large group, almost everyone will assume that someone else is going to offer help. As a result, it is unlikely that anyone will help. In a small group, each person is much less likely to assume that someone else will help, so each individual person is more likely to offer help.</p>

<h1>The Milgram Experiment</h1>
<p>In 1961, Stanley Milgram, a Professor at Yale devised an experiment to study how much harm someone would do to another simply because they were told to by an authority figure. In the experiment, a test subject meets an actor pretending to be another test subject, whom they are separated from. The subject is put in a room with the experimenter, and the actor goes into a room where the subject can hear, but not see them. The subject is told to administer electric shocks through a control panel when the actor incorrectly answers questions on a test. After each wrong answer, the voltage of the shock increases. The actor did not in fact receive any electric shocks, there was however a recording of the actor pretending to respond to the shocks that was played along with each one. For the higher voltages, the recording was of the actor screaming in pain, and begging the subject to stop. For some of the very highest voltages, the recording was silent, and stayed silent through the end.</p>

<p>65% of test subjects were willing to administer the full voltage, although none of them did it without some hesitation and questioning. This result was a shock to the scientific community, who had predicted that only a small fraction of participants would be willing to administer the full voltage.</p>

<h1>What next?</h1>
<p>These two examples, The Bystander Effect, and The Milgram Experiment, show how easy it is to defer authority. The average person seems willing to let another die, simply because they shirk their responsibility off to a faceless and nameless crowd. Furthermore, it seems that many people are willing to inflict suffering and even death on an innocent person, simply because they were instructed to be someone with authority.</p>

<p>This is the tendency of our minds, to shirk off moral obligation by surrendering to the crowd, or to the powers that be. Armed with this information a person may be able to better resist the temptation to complacency, but no one is going to be perfect. You would have to resist your brain’s natural state constantly.</p>

<p>How can anyone hope to live a moral life, when our minds are fighting against us from the cradle to the grave?</p>

<p>What hope is there for any of us?</p>
