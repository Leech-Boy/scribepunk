<p>I was mindlessly scrolling through my Substack homepage, when I read a note that referenced this story.</p>

<a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/zoraya-ter-beek-dead-assisted-suicide">She Was 29. And Doctors Helped Her Die.</a>
<p>I was stopped dead in my (digital) tracks.

I didn’t even read the article, and I was still too upset to sit still. I went for a walk. After walking a bit, I sat down and tracked down the article that the note referenced and started reading it. After reading most of the article I had to start walking again. I was too angry.</p>

<p class="quote">“My whole friends and my support system, we really did it together.”</p>

<p>In what kind of world does a person’s “support system” help them towards suicide. This is not support, this is abandonment.

Eventually, I finished reading the article. All the while my mind was reeling at the darkness of the world.

The words of a poem floated through my head, so I decided to write it down. At the end of the poem, I also reference the life and death of Terry Davis, another outcast whose tragically took his own life.</p>

<hr>

<!--excerpt-start-->
<p>Darkness inside all of us
flows outward.
All our sin clouds our souls until we no longer see other humans.
The darkness is so thick we cannot see how far it goes.</p>
<!--excerpt-end-->

<p>Insight flashes like lightning.
The world illuminated for a split second.
Shock and horror.

What do you do when you realize it’s not just you.
It’s not just your own sin,
seeping outward,
clouding the world.
It’s not just your friends,
your family.

Eight Billion People.
Eight Billion faces you will never see.
Eight Billion names you will never hear.
Their sins, visible and invisible, muddy the world.

You cannot save all the innocents,
you cannot even save your own innocence.


They will hurt you, and never know it.
You will hurt them, and never realize it.


Names you will not remember
write tales of evil perpetrated by human beings in faraway lands,
cutting your heart to its core.


A sick woman is betrayed by those who swore to heal her.
They give up on her and offer death.
She no longer wishes to live, and they pronounce her mind sound.
A contradiction.
Not that she wishes to die, for to die is gain,
but that she wishes to give up on life, the greatest gift.


A confused man speaks to thousands.
God speaks to him through the radio, so he gets working on his computer.
They give him medicine to “fix” him,
but with his delusions he also loses his creativity.
He rejects their cure,
declares himself king,
and walks in front of a train.


Jesus, where’s the reason?
Jesus, where’s the hope?
Jesus Christ, won’t you save them?
They need you,
they’re dying.</p>
