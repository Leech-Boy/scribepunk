<p class="line">Where do you go when the going is over?</p>
<p class="line">Whom do you fight when the battle is done?</p>
<!--excerpt-end-->
<p class="line">Man stands alone on the peak of the mountain,</p>
<p class="line">tall, dark, commanding, but he is alone.</p>
<p class="line">Wounds have been sutured and fevers have broken.</p>
<p class="line">Bags have been readied, and tears have been stitched.</p>
<p class="line">Far from his homeland, his friends and his family,</p>
<p class="line">bearing the weight of this terrible curse.</p>
<p class="line">If love is the curse, then the curing is hopeless</p>
<p class="line">for curse it is, present, or absent, or wrong,</p>
<p class="line">but hate was the curse that had spoiled his spirit,</p>
<p class="line">hatred of man and a hatred of God.</p>
<p class="line">Alone in the vastness of space he finds respite.</p>
<p class="line">The demon awaits him if he should return.</p>
<p class="line">He climbed from this shadow of death from the valley;</p>
<p class="line">The shadow departed when he touched the sky.</p>
<p class="line">The shadow awaits should he come down the mountain.</p>
<p class="line">Dilemma confronts him, his friends are below.</p>
<p class="line">He climbed without them, though not without sendoff.</p>
<p class="line">They watched from the ground as he fled from his foe.</p>
<p class="line">Sun lit his journey, his friends came to see him,</p>
<p class="line">tenderly bandaging all of his wounds.</p>
<p class="line">Fog hid his figure. His friends did not seek him.</p>
<p class="line">Trembling hands, can’t but worsen his wounds.</p>
<p class="line">Better malpractice by hands of a loved one,</p>
<p class="line">than the best surgery completed alone.</p>
<p class="line">Spurred by the prophecy of his deliverance,</p>
<p class="line">midst that rock fortress that’s older than hate.</p>
<p class="line">Not by the torture of spirits he’s hurt now,</p>
<p class="line">but only the dull ache of something not right.</p>
<p class="line">Not that he misses those hands that had healed him,</p>
<p class="line">but that he wishes, those friends he could help.</p>
<p class="line">How do you love when you’re far from the lovely?</p>
<p class="line">How do you tell them you love them from here?</p>
